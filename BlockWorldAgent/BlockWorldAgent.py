    def solve(self, initial_arrangement, goal_arrangement):
        #Add your code here! Your solve method should receive
		#as input two arrangements of blocks. The arrangements
		#will be given as lists of lists. The first item in each
		#list will be the bottom block on a stack, proceeding
		#upward. For example, this arrangement:
		#
		#[["A", "B", "C"], ["D", "E"]]
		#
		#...represents two stacks of blocks: one with B on top
		#of A and C on top of B, and one with E on top of D.
		#
		#Your goal is to return a list of moves that will convert
		#the initial arrangement into the goal arrangement.
		#Moves should be represented as 2-tuples where the first
		#item in the 2-tuple is what block to move, and the
		#second item is where to put it: either on top of another
		#block or on the table (represented by the string "Table").
		#
		#For example, these moves would represent moving block B
		#from the first stack to the second stack in the example
		#above:
		#
		#("C", "Table")
		#("B", "E")
		#("C", "A")
